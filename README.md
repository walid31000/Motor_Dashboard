<h1>AVR Project :Motor Dashboard</h1>
Introduction: The objective of this project is to develop a motor dashboard capable of enabling users to control both a DC motor and a stepper motor. Users will have the ability to manage the rotation direction of the DC motor, and for the stepper motor, they can control both the rotation direction and the rotation angle.
<h2>Hardware Requirements </h2>
To implement this project, you will need the following hardware components:

AVR microcontroller (ATmega32)
Motor driver module ( H bridge with 4 transistors NPN 2N2222)
Motor driver module ( ULN2003A)
DC ,Stepper  Motors to be controlled
Keypad for entering credentials
Display module (LCD) for displaying the dashboard

<h3>Software Requirements</h3>
The following software tools are required for developing and programming the AVR microcontroller:

AVR development environment (Eclipse)
Appropriate AVR programming language ( C programming language)
